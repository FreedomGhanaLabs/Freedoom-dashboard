## Features

The platform includes functionalities, designed to streamline operations and enhance efficiency. These are logically organized into distinct routing modules, such as `(auth)` for all authentication-related flows and `dashboard` for the main administrative and operational interfaces:

- **User Authentication:** Handling login, registration, password reset, and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) setup via OTP.
- **Admin Panel:** A comprehensive interface for managing users, drivers, rides, deliveries, financial data, support tickets, and system activity. Offers role-based access control for enhanced security.
- **Driver Management:** Includes features for viewing driver profiles, managing documents (licenses, insurance), tracking performance metrics (ratings, completion rate), and handling debt issues with automated alerts and reports.
- **Ride & Delivery Management:** Enables administrators to monitor real-time ride and delivery status, view detailed route information, manage pricing, and resolve disputes.
- **Financial & Commission Management:** Provides tools for configuring dynamic commission rates based on various factors (payment method, service type), automated expense tracking, revenue analysis, and customizable financial reports.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Offers a comprehensive suite of dashboards and reports, providing insights into platform usage trends, user growth, driver performance metrics, financial summaries, and operational efficiency. Includes data visualization tools and export options, along with predictive analytics capabilities.
- **Support System:** Functionality to manage support tickets, including viewing details, assigning agents, updating status, prioritizing requests, and generating support performance reports. Integrates with knowledge base and FAQ resources.
