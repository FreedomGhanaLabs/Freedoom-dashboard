# Route Protection Plan for SvelteKit Dashboard

This document outlines the plan to implement authenticated route protection for the dashboard section of the SvelteKit application, ensuring only logged-in users can access these routes.

## Goal

Implement authenticated route protection for the dashboard.

## Plan

1.  **Create `src/hooks.server.ts`:**
    *   This file will contain the `handle` function, which is a server-side hook that runs for every request. It will be responsible for checking the authentication status.

2.  **Implement `handle` function in `src/hooks.server.ts`:**
    *   **Authentication Check:** Inside the `handle` function, I will check for an authentication token or session identifier in the request's cookies.
        *   *Assumption:* For demonstration purposes, a simple cookie named `session_id` will be assumed to exist upon successful login. In a real application, this would involve verifying the token with a backend service or decrypting a session.
    *   **`locals` object:** Populate `event.locals.user` with user information if authenticated, making it accessible in `+page.server.ts` and `+layout.server.ts` files.

3.  **Modify `src/routes/dashboard/+layout.server.ts` (or create it if it doesn't exist):**
    *   This file will contain a `load` function.
    *   **Route Protection Logic:** Within this `load` function, I will check `event.locals.user`. If `event.locals.user` is not set (indicating an unauthenticated user), I will redirect them to the login page (`/`). This ensures all routes under `/dashboard` are protected.

4.  **Test the implementation:**
    *   Manually test by trying to access `/dashboard` and its sub-routes without logging in.
    *   Log in and verify access.
    *   Log out and verify redirection.
